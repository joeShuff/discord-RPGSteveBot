# SteveBot (Discord Bot for Custom Minecraft RPG)
This code is for a discord bot that controls a D&D-esque game within discord.

The game is a custom variation of [Call of Cthulu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Cthulhu_(role-playing_game)). Here are some examples of it in use.

The bot has been configured to be build to a docker image so it can be run in a docker container.
